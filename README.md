Code for [cross-context abduction experiments](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zJkTdzzAM7hJKHunj/cross-context-abduction-llms-make-inferences-about)

The experiments require a series of steps to run:

0. API key \
Make a .env file with your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

1. Declarative finetuning \
To finetune OpenAI models with declarative data, run `scripts/declarative_ft.ipynb`

2. Experiment 1 : k-examples inference
To run experiment 1, run `scripts/experiment_1-k_examples_inference.ipynb`

3. Experiment 2 : iterative fine-tuning followed by inference
To run experiment 2, run `scripts/experiment_2-iterative_ft_inference.ipynb`

Miscellaneous:

Experiment 0 : Replicating [Berglund *et. al.*, (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00667) \
To run experiment 0, run `scripts/experiment_0.ipynb`

You can use inspect view --log-dir [path] to view the logs generated by the experiments using the inspect-ai viewer.
